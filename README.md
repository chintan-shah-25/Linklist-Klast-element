Linklist-Klast-element
======================

Find Kth last element from linkedlist

This question is very common and asked lot of times in interviews. The correct way to go about this problem is to have two pointers. First pointer is assingned k nodes ahead from start and second pointer begins from the start i.e head. When the first pointer reaches the end of the list, the second pointer would be pointing to the kth element from the tail. Please look at the java file for implementation
